# Handwritten OCR

## Introduction

Handwritten OCR is a Python-based optical character recognition (OCR) system designed to recognize handwritten text from images.

### In this project we used two approaches:-

1. using ANN (Artifical Neural Network)
2. using Random Forest

## Features

- Recognizes handwritten text from images.
- Supports various image formats such as JPEG, PNG, and BMP.
- Uses machine learning algorithms for accurate character recognition.
- [TODO] Provides easy-to-use APIs for integration into existing applications.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   `git clone https://github.com/21amir21/handwritten-ocr.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   `cd handwritten-ocr`

3. Install dependencies:
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## EMNIST Dataset

The EMNIST dataset is a collection of handwritten characters derived from the NIST Special Database 19 and converted to a more manageable format. It contains 814,255 characters divided into 814,255 training images and 81,224 testing images. You can download the dataset used for this project from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/crawford/emnist).
